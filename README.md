http://mateusfccp.me is my personal website/blog.

This is the source of the site, built with Hugo (the generated static files are included because I'm pushing it to Docker Hub).

[This](http://mateusfccp.me/posts/docker-and-hugo/) (currently only in Portuguese, I'm translating it to English) is a post that shows **how** I quickly built this website (although the current state of the source is considerably different as it evolved).

The theme used on this website is [mateusfccp.me-hugo](https://github.com/mateusfccp/mateusfccp.me-hugo), a fork of [hello-friend-ng](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/).
